This is a simple script designed to allow quick and easy directory navigation without all of the typing.
Not any real error handeling built in, the script should just work if you type the command in the right format.
Format:
	$ . jumpTo <directory>
	  or
	$ source jumpTo <directory>
Example:
	$ . jumpTo bin
	  or
	$ source jumpTo bin

I would recommend aliasing the command in your .bashrc so as to reduce the extra characters. Personally I alias
the command as jt=". jumpTo".
