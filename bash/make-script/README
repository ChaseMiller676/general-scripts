This script is meant to automate the creation of an empty script. It's basically touch but for making scripts.
The script is very bare bones, so theres not much need for error checking or anything. The only things to be aware of is
this script won't create a file that has the same name as a file in the working directory, and the shell flag doesn't have
any sanitization, so you won't be told if you've entered an actual shell language or not.

Command Format:
	$ makeScript <file-name> <shell>
Example:
	$ makeScipt myScript bash
